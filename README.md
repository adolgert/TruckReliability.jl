# TruckReliability

Simulates a truck reliability problem where there are `N` trucks and each day `M` are sent out to work. There is a distribution of times for the work day and a distribution of times for failure, where the failure depends on total hours worked since the last repair. Repair also has a distribution of times.

I'm using CompetingClocks.jl in order to see how it works.
